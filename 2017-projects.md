### [SGJ](https://github.com/sarahchou/AgeRecognition) ###

#### Made by Sarah Chou, Grace Hall, and Jamie Cirne ####

Our idea was an iOS application that uses the camera and/or photo library to upload a picture and using Watson (IBM's API) will be able to find missing kids or human traffickers and display information about them such as gender, age range, and facial expression. But what we ended up accomplishing (since it was our first time using Swift and Xcode, was an application that could change the background of the app based on the photo taken or uploaded. Also includes a dummy html page that shows information that IBM's Watson API WOULD produce after viewing the photo and detecting facial features such as age, gender, and expressions.
