HackBeanpot Projects
--------------------

A listing of projects made at HackBeanpot.

### Where do I edit my project list?

There's a markdown file for each annual HackBeanpot event in the root directory.
For example, if you want to add a HackBeanpot 2016 project, look for
`2016-projects.md`. Make your changes there. Fork, edit, then send us a
pull-request. Easy-peasy.

You can add as much or as little contact info as you wish. Feel free to link
to your project's page/repo, or turn the names into links to personal webpages
or twitters.
