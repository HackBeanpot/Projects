### [Poetification](https://www.github.com/pietdaniel/poetification) (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Daniel Piet, Pasha Sadikov, Tiffney Kitiratanasumpun ####

Poetification is a free tool transmogrifying your Twitter, Facebook, and possible other data sources into a poem. The tweets and the like are atomic, so they won't be changed. The poem will be presented in a clean, sharable fashion through a well designed web interface. The intended demographic is all literary lovers, poets, and artisans, et cetera. 

### [The Shaft](https://github.com/ckolek/shaft/) ###
#### Made by Chris Kolek, Ryan Sullivan, and Deniz Ozkaynak ####

A social Android app that lets users create or join groups of friends and share embarrassing and hilarious stories about each other. Users can vote on each other's stories throughout the week (votes hidden). At the end of the week the top story is revealed and wins the title of "The Shaft" until next week.
