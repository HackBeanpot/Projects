Poetification is a free tool transmogrifying your Twitter, Facebook, and possible other data sources into a poem. The tweets and the like are atomic, so they won't be changed. The poem will be presented in a clean, sharable fashion through a well designed web interface. The intended demographic is all literary lovers, poets, and artisans, et cetera.
