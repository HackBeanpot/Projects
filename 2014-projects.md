### [BitCoffee](http://coffeehack.herokuapp.com/) (Won Most Innovative!) ###
#### Made by Andrew Sousa and Zach Ferland ####

A keurig machine that was torn apart and put back together with an aruduino, ir
sensors and wifi connectivity. It allows people to purchase a coffee in Bitcoin.
You pay and then it will begin to dispense coffee once you place your cup down.
It serves as a model of what could be a protocol for bitcoin on connected
objects as well as an example of instant or zero confirmation payments in
bitcoin.

### [Applitude](https://github.com/arjunblj/applitude) (Won Most Fun!) ###
#### Made by Arjun Balaji and Luke Van Seters ####

There is currently a grave deficit of audio-based adaptive color displays. With
new technology such as Hue looking to help users express themselves in the
somewhat untouched realm of illumination, we seek to be their shining light.

### [Echodrop](https://github.com/nickr500/echodrop) (Won Best Design!) ###
#### Made by Matt Kolosick, Chris Beiser, Jacqueline Ali, Amelia Oon, Benji Smith, Nick Rioux, Allison Alder, Durward Benham, and Nikolai Wotton ####

Our application allows the user to anonymously place sounds at their location,
allowing people who walk by that area to listen to these sounds. We see it as a
way to enable homegrown artistic endeavor, free from the narcissism of ‘social
media.’ We believe that in the digital age, it is critical to the human
experience that there remain places free of ‘curation,’ in which intimate
connections with passing strangers are allowed to retain their enduring mystery,
and in which some information isn’t made universally accessible.

### [GiftGuru](http://giftguru.herokuapp.com) (Won Intuit's Prize) ###
#### Made by Lili Jiang and Styliani (Stella) Pantela ####

GiftGuru generates personalized gift suggestions for your loved ones and
friends. After the gift receiver fills out his/her personal picks through our
site or imports facebook likes, we analyze the data and call the amazon API to
construct a set of most relevant gift recommendations. Target market is mainly
college students and recent graduates, but it applies to everyone who faces gift
picking difficulties.

### [Poetification](https://www.github.com/pietdaniel/poetification) (Won Least Likely to Make Money!) ###
#### Made by Daniel Piet, Pasha Sadikov, and Tiffney Kitiratanasumpun ####

Poetification is a free tool transmogrifying your Twitter, Facebook, and
possible other data sources into a poem. The tweets and the like are atomic, so
they won't be changed. The poem will be presented in a clean, sharable fashion
through a well designed web interface. The intended demographic is all literary
lovers, poets, and artisans, et cetera.

### [Productify](https://github.com/uvarovis/Productify) (Won Best Quantified Self Hack) ###
#### Made by Asaph Yuan and Ivan Uvarov ####

It's a Chrome extension that tracks the time people spend on different
categories of the website and presents this information to users in various
forms including pie graph with daily statistics, bubble graph with weekly
statistics etc. Also, it allows users to set limits for the time they spend on
certain categories. When the limit is reached, the extension automatically
blocks websites of this specific category. Furthermore, it allows users to enter
distraction-free mode, where the extension blocks time-consuming website, such
as social networks. So, it solves one of the biggest college students' problem,
allowing them to spend time on the web more productively.

### [SnappyLink](https://github.com/huyle333/snappylink) (Won Intuit's Prize) ###
#### Made by Huy Le, Tianyou Luo, Winston Chen, and Guanchen Zhang (Owen) ####

Users who browse through Reddit, Google, Wikipedia, news articles, Bing, and
YouTube want information quickly and easily. With the SnappyLink Chrome
extension, users may preview every article, Google link, YouTube video, and
Reddit post by hovering their mouse over the link. The Chrome extension pops a
mini browser within the space that displays a preview of the link, so that users
can see whether the information is useful to them or not. Users don't want to
waste time clicking links to read content from every page while going back and
forth, back and forth. Instead, they want speed and efficiency to see the
content that they need to find. The target market are users of all ages. Every
user wants to see his or her information as fast as possible especially the
growing demographic of high school and college students who own personal
laptops. We exploit the abundant users of data connecting websites like Google,
Wikipedia, and YouTube, and provide a Chrome extension that eases and speeds the
processing of information on the web.

### Untitled Mixtapes (Won Best Use of APIs!) ###
#### Made by Zack Hickman, Nat Dempkowski, and Sanders Lauture ####

Untitled Mixtapes is a python-backed web application that generates mixtape
playlists, based on a given track, that actually make sense.

Simply putting similar songs together is something that works for a plain
playlist, but when you create a mixtape, there's some subjectivity involved in
knowing how to pick which songs go in which order. We created a product that
solves this subjective problem objectively.

Untitled Mixtapes hand picks beginning and ending songs specifically, and
generates the entire middle sequence based on related artists, the energy level
from the user-provided track, and some settings that can be manipulated by the
user, like number of tracks and diversity in genres.

The algorithm behind Untitled Mixtapes builds the mixtape alternating between
faster and slower songs around the original track's energy level, moving from
songs more similar to the original artist towards songs in further away genres.
This creates a fresh experience for the listener and a chance to hear tracks in
genres they had previously never given a chance. They can decide how diverse
they want their mixtape to be.

We use last.fm's API for related artists and EchoNest's API to find track titles
from related artists, and detailed track information afterwards. The detailed
information we receive from this API is the core behind the track selection
algorithm. Finally, we use Spotify's API to publish the final playlist.

### [Split](https://github.com/tswartz/split) (Won Best Use of APIs!) ###
#### Made by Rose DeMaio and Talia Swartz ####

The age old problem of when your friends don't pay you for gas when you drive
them places. Gosh, guys. Stop doing that.

### [Adventur](https://github.com/dcalacci/adventur) (Won Most Innovative!) ###
#### Made by John Martin, James Magnarelli, Eric Chin, Alex Jolly, and Dan Calacci ####

How many people really think about how boring they are? How many people miss out
on exciting new experiences just outside of their daily routine?

Are you one of those people? Wouldn't you like to know?

Be the Indiana Jones of your social group.

Explore new frontiers, just around the corner.
Experience Adventur.

Adventur provides you with a quantitative measure of how adventurous you are and
helps you find highly rated points of interest just outside of your geographic
'comfort zone'.

Adventur uses your past location history to create a probabilistic model that is
capable of predicting your future movements and creating a measurement of how
predictable your past movements have been.

### [AJAT Social Gaming Platform](https://github.com/AJATInc/AJATDC) (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Alexey Shablygin, John O'rourke, Tyler McCabe, and Adam Power ####

AJAT framework provides (or eventually will provide) a flexible way to create,
organize and manage social role playing games (such as human vs. zombies). The
main goal of AJAT is to encourage individuals/groups to create new exciting role
playing games, or to modify existing ones, easily add players, and create all
sorts of interactive events and challenges by incorporating Google Geolocation
API. As a player, you will have a mobile app that allows you to keep track of
your active games/join new ones, location activated game events and personal
stats. As an administrator, you will have (again, eventually) a large variety of
options to manage and modify your own game to fit specific preferences of your
player base. The AJAT framework works across all three major operating systems,
and will also provide a web-based interface as well.

### [baskets.io](https://github.com/dboudro/baskets.io) (Finalist) ###
#### Made by Dylan Boudro and Kate Hutchinson ####

Baskets.io visualizes important spheres of your life using D3.js

We create one 'basket' visualization for each aspect of your life you would like
to monitor (eg. Academic, Financial, Sleep, Health, etc).

Each basket contains nodes that correspond to important events in that sphere of
your life. A large red node would depict a big purchase in your financial sphere
while a small purple node would depict a power nap in your sleep schedule
sphere.

We think this product could be used for business productivity tracking, personal
management... really anything that needs to be easily and playfully tracked!

### [The Daily Planet](http://namank.github.io/DailyPlanet/) (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Avery Gray, Namank Shah, and Nilesh Khaitan ####

The Daily Planet is your newspaper on the globe. It displays an interactive map
interface, with news headlines about the countries in the map displayed on the
left. The headlines have links to the full content of the articles. It allows
users to search and jump to a location, and get relevant news articles for that
location. The entire interface is dynamic, intuitive to use and real-time.
Currently, we are working on adding filters by topics (Technology, Sports, etc.)

### [Crosspath](https://github.com/DiscoverPioneer/Halfway) (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Alex Koshy, Catherine Feldman, Phil Scarfi, Justin Marple, and Marc Rudowski ####

The app allows users to efficiently form groups and coordinate meeting places
that are equidistant from each member. Users can quickly determine a meeting
place and communicate it to the group through an intuitive visual display of
results. Places can be viewed on a map or as a list. [Second github

### [General Chombie](http://generalchombie.com) (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Marco Chiang and Steven Tso ####

Ever set up an alarm in the morning only to find yourself snoozing all the time
and leaving yourself an unknown amount of time to get ready for class or work?

General Chombie is the ultimate Pebble application that keeps you on track with
your schedule. We break your morning routine down and set a timer for each
individual task.

For example, wake up at 6am and the first task is to shower. Your watch wakes
you up and tells you your first task is to shower and starts the timer for 10
minutes to get in and out. As soon as your 10 minutes is up it moves onto the
next task. You now have 2 minutes to brush your teeth... etc.

Our goal is to help business professionals, students, and anyone with a routine
to make sure they are on schedule to make sure they can get to the important
things in their day.

### [Food Boy](https://github.com/HBP-BadApples/HBPFoodBoy) ###
#### Tommy Nguyen, Nate Fuller, David Nguyen, Jenny Jolley, and Ari Ross ####

Our project is Food Boy. Perhaps one of the many soon to be known names that
have risen from nowhere. Angry Birds, Flappy Bird, anyone can name it. Simple,
yet challenging. Developed as an Applet and soon to be ported to the Android
platform, Food Boy will meet its way into the market. The mechanics involve
rapidly grabbing and eating food from conveyor belts, without grabbing spoiled
food or letting food be spilled on the floor. Test your luck against Food Boy! A
game for all ages.

### [Fuel](https://github.com/timothychong/Fuel-App) ###
#### Made by Akshar Bonu, Timothy Chong, and Calvin Chin ####

Fuel leverages key aspects of human nature -- the desire to set challenges for
oneself. But, we are not like the millions of other challenge apps are there
because we've made a challenge app that makes sure that you never fail -- that
you never run out of fuel.

When you make a challenge, you're motivated, you know exactly why you're doing
what you're doing. Over the course of your challenge, you may want to give up
because you've forgotten or can't feel what made you start. We solve that.

Fuel lets you save what inspired you to make your challenge as messages, videos,
and images to your later self that can recall on them when he or she maybe low
on inspiration -- or as we like to say, low on fuel.

We've made a challenge app that actually works.
