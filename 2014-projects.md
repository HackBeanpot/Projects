### [Poetification](https://www.github.com/pietdaniel/poetification) (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Daniel Piet, Pasha Sadikov, and Tiffney Kitiratanasumpun ####

Poetification is a free tool transmogrifying your Twitter, Facebook, and possible other data sources into a poem. The tweets and the like are atomic, so they won't be changed. The poem will be presented in a clean, sharable fashion through a well designed web interface. The intended demographic is all literary lovers, poets, and artisans, et cetera. 

### [Echodrop](https://github.com/nickr500/echodrop) (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Matt Kolosick, Chris Beiser, Jacqueline Ali, Amelia Oon, Benji Smith, Nick Rioux, Allison Alder, Durward Benham, and Nikolai Wotton ####

Our application allows the user to anonymously place sounds at their location, allowing people who walk by that area to listen to these sounds. We see it as a way to enable homegrown artistic endeavor, free from the narcissism of ‘social media.’ We believe that in the digital age, it is critical to the human experience that there remain places free of ‘curation,’ in which intimate connections with passing strangers are allowed to retain their enduring mystery, and in which some information isn’t made universally accessible.

### Untitled Mixtapes (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Zack Hickman, Nat Dempkowski, and Sanders Lauture ####

Untitled Mixtapes is a python-backed web application that generates mixtape playlists, based on a given track, that actually make sense. 

Simply putting similar songs together is something that works for a plain playlist, but when you create a mixtape, there's some subjectivity involved in knowing how to pick which songs go in which order. We created a product that solves this subjective problem objectively.

Untitled Mixtapes hand picks beginning and ending songs specifically, and generates the entire middle sequence based on related artists, the energy level from the user-provided track, and some settings that can be manipulated by the user, like number of tracks and diversity in genres.

The algorithm behind Untitled Mixtapes builds the mixtape alternating between faster and slower songs around the original track's energy level, moving from songs more similar to the original artist towards songs in further away genres. This creates a fresh experience for the listener and a chance to hear tracks in genres they had previously never given a chance. They can decide how diverse they want their mixtape to be.

We use last.fm's API for related artists and EchoNest's API to find track titles from related artists, and detailed track information afterwards. The detailed information we receive from this API is the core behind the track selection algorithm. Finally, we use Spotify's API to publish the final playlist.

### [Playlistr](https://github.com/hustheman/playlistmaker) ###
#### Made by Gasper Chan, Michael Hu, Geoffrey Wong, and Matthew Coleman #### 

Everyone who's ever hosted a party or any other type of social gathering knows how difficult it can be to try to create that perfect playlist. Worry no more! With Playlistr, it's a breeze for your friends to help you find and play the music for an unforgettable experience.

### [The Shaft](https://github.com/ckolek/shaft/) ###
#### Made by Chris Kolek, Ryan Sullivan, and Deniz Ozkaynak ####

A social Android app that lets users create or join groups of friends and share embarrassing and hilarious stories about each other. Users can vote on each other's stories throughout the week (votes hidden). At the end of the week the top story is revealed and wins the title of "The Shaft" until next week.

### [Whisperer](http://whisperer.herokuapp.com/) ###
#### Made by John Kohler, Lukas Berger, and Greg Skloot ####

Connects with Facebook so users can post about their friends anonymously. Similar to the popular Facebook groups like 'northeastern complements' and 'spotted', but offers a cleaner interface and immediate posting without a middle-man.

### [Why Not](https://github.com/stephalee/challenge) ###
#### Made by Korbin Shuffleton, Martin Manser, and Stephanie Lee ####

An app that allows users to create and complete challenges. The goal is to provide a medium for people to encourage others to try different activities in the form of challenges.   https://github.com/stephalee/challenge
