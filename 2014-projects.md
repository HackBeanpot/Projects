### [Poetification](https://www.github.com/pietdaniel/poetification) (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Daniel Piet, Pasha Sadikov, Tiffney Kitiratanasumpun ####

Poetification is a free tool transmogrifying your Twitter, Facebook, and possible other data sources into a poem. The tweets and the like are atomic, so they won't be changed. The poem will be presented in a clean, sharable fashion through a well designed web interface. The intended demographic is all literary lovers, poets, and artisans, et cetera. 

### [Echodrop](https://github.com/nickr500/echodrop) (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Matt Kolosick, Chris Beiser, Jacqueline Ali, Amelia Oon, Benji Smith, Nick Rioux, Allison Alder, Durward Benham, and Nikolai Wotton ####

Our application allows the user to anonymously place sounds at their location, allowing people who walk by that area to listen to these sounds. We see it as a way to enable homegrown artistic endeavor, free from the narcissism of ‘social media.’ We believe that in the digital age, it is critical to the human experience that there remain places free of ‘curation,’ in which intimate connections with passing strangers are allowed to retain their enduring mystery, and in which some information isn’t made universally accessible.

### [The Shaft](https://github.com/ckolek/shaft/) ###
#### Made by Chris Kolek, Ryan Sullivan, and Deniz Ozkaynak ####

A social Android app that lets users create or join groups of friends and share embarrassing and hilarious stories about each other. Users can vote on each other's stories throughout the week (votes hidden). At the end of the week the top story is revealed and wins the title of "The Shaft" until next week.
