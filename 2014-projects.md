### [BitCoffee](http://coffeehack.herokuapp.com/) (Won Most Innovative!) ###
#### Made by Andrew Sousa and Zach Ferland ####

A keurig machine that was torn apart and put back together with an aruduino, ir
sensors and wifi connectivity. It allows people to purchase a coffee in Bitcoin.
You pay and then it will begin to dispense coffee once you place your cup down.
It serves as a model of what could be a protocol for bitcoin on connected
objects as well as an example of instant or zero confirmation payments in
bitcoin.

### [GiftGuru](http://giftguru.herokuapp.com) ###
#### Lili Jiang, Styliani (Stella) Pantela ####

GiftGuru generates personalized gift suggestions for your loved ones and
friends. After the gift receiver fills out his/her personal picks through our
site or imports facebook likes, we analyze the data and call the amazon API to
construct a set of most relevant gift recommendations. Target market is mainly
college students and recent graduates, but it applies to everyone who faces gift
picking difficulties.

### [Poetification](https://www.github.com/pietdaniel/poetification) (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Daniel Piet, Pasha Sadikov, and Tiffney Kitiratanasumpun ####

Poetification is a free tool transmogrifying your Twitter, Facebook, and
possible other data sources into a poem. The tweets and the like are atomic, so
they won't be changed. The poem will be presented in a clean, sharable fashion
through a well designed web interface. The intended demographic is all literary
lovers, poets, and artisans, et cetera.

### [Echodrop](https://github.com/nickr500/echodrop) (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Matt Kolosick, Chris Beiser, Jacqueline Ali, Amelia Oon, Benji Smith, Nick Rioux, Allison Alder, Durward Benham, and Nikolai Wotton ####

Our application allows the user to anonymously place sounds at their location,
allowing people who walk by that area to listen to these sounds. We see it as a
way to enable homegrown artistic endeavor, free from the narcissism of ‘social
media.’ We believe that in the digital age, it is critical to the human
experience that there remain places free of ‘curation,’ in which intimate
connections with passing strangers are allowed to retain their enduring mystery,
and in which some information isn’t made universally accessible.

### Untitled Mixtapes (Won Best Use of APIs!) ###
#### Made by Zack Hickman, Nat Dempkowski, and Sanders Lauture ####

Untitled Mixtapes is a python-backed web application that generates mixtape
playlists, based on a given track, that actually make sense.

Simply putting similar songs together is something that works for a plain
playlist, but when you create a mixtape, there's some subjectivity involved in
knowing how to pick which songs go in which order. We created a product that
solves this subjective problem objectively.

Untitled Mixtapes hand picks beginning and ending songs specifically, and
generates the entire middle sequence based on related artists, the energy level
from the user-provided track, and some settings that can be manipulated by the
user, like number of tracks and diversity in genres.

The algorithm behind Untitled Mixtapes builds the mixtape alternating between
faster and slower songs around the original track's energy level, moving from
songs more similar to the original artist towards songs in further away genres.
This creates a fresh experience for the listener and a chance to hear tracks in
genres they had previously never given a chance. They can decide how diverse
they want their mixtape to be.

We use last.fm's API for related artists and EchoNest's API to find track titles
from related artists, and detailed track information afterwards. The detailed
information we receive from this API is the core behind the track selection
algorithm. Finally, we use Spotify's API to publish the final playlist.

### [Adventur](https://github.com/dcalacci/adventur) (Won Most Innovative!) ###
#### Made by John Martin, James Magnarelli, Eric Chin, Alex Jolly, and Dan Calacci ####

How many people really think about how boring they are? How many people miss out
on exciting new experiences just outside of their daily routine?

Are you one of those people? Wouldn't you like to know?

Be the Indiana Jones of your social group.

Explore new frontiers, just around the corner.
Experience Adventur.

--

Adventur provides you with a quantitative measure of how adventurous you are and
helps you find highly rated points of interest just outside of your geographic
'comfort zone'.

Adventur uses your past location history to create a probabilistic model that is
capable of predicting your future movements and creating a measurement of how
predictable your past movements have been.

### [The Daily Planet](http://namank.github.io/DailyPlanet/) (Finalist!) ###
#### Made by Avery Gray, Namank Shah, and Nilesh Khaitan ####

The Daily Planet is your newspaper on the globe. It displays an interactive map
interface, with news headlines about the countries in the map displayed on the
left. The headlines have links to the full content of the articles. It allows
users to search and jump to a location, and get relevant news articles for that
location. The entire interface is dynamic, intuitive to use and real-time.
Currently, we are working on adding filters by topics (Technology, Sports, etc.)

### [Food Boy](https://github.com/HBP-BadApples/HBPFoodBoy) ###
#### Tommy Nguyen, Nate Fuller, David Nguyen, Jenny Jolley, and Ari Ross ####

Our project is Food Boy. Perhaps one of the many soon to be known names that
have risen from nowhere. Angry Birds, Flappy Bird, anyone can name it. Simple,
yet challenging. Developed as an Applet and soon to be ported to the Android
platform, Food Boy will meet its way into the market. The mechanics involve
rapidly grabbing and eating food from conveyor belts, without grabbing spoiled
food or letting food be spilled on the floor. Test your luck against Food Boy! A
game for all ages.

### Plateonic ###
#### Oleg Vaskevich, Cameron Sun, Konstantin Gizdarski, Kevin Yang, and Bobby Singh ####

### [Playlistr](https://github.com/hustheman/playlistmaker) ###
#### Made by Gasper Chan, Michael Hu, Geoffrey Wong, and Matthew Coleman #### 

Everyone who's ever hosted a party or any other type of social gathering knows
how difficult it can be to try to create that perfect playlist. Worry no more!
With Playlistr, it's a breeze for your friends to help you find and play the
music for an unforgettable experience.

### [The Shaft](https://github.com/ckolek/shaft/) ###
#### Made by Chris Kolek, Ryan Sullivan, and Deniz Ozkaynak ####

A social Android app that lets users create or join groups of friends and share
embarrassing and hilarious stories about each other. Users can vote on each
other's stories throughout the week (votes hidden). At the end of the week the
top story is revealed and wins the title of "The Shaft" until next week.

### [Simplifly](https://github.com/secretformula/simplifly) ###
#### Made by Nigil Lee, Kevin Oleary, and Noah Bedford ####

Email is overwhelming. Notes from lovers, haters, spammers, scammers, and
everything above, below, and in between bombard you in a neverending assault,
and when you try to hide in your titanium bomb shelter, they flood you and you
drown. Don't worry, though-- Simplifly is here to reincarnate you as a sleek
silver fox, concerned only with events, _non-spam- promotions, and shipping
data.

Your email is now a to-do list. You are now focused, adept. You now know exactly
how many pieces of fruit your mother wants, where and when the party starts,
where your package is and how to get the best deal on watermelons, all through a
gorgeous card UI backed by cutting edge natural language processing.

Simplifly will stop at nothing to increase your productivity, routing your every
email through our highly trained robot assassins, each keen on destroying the
unnecessary information bound on binding you to an inferior and pitiable
existence. You'll be safe with them, rising up into the stratos in a comfortable
armchair, enjoying the power of simpliflight."

### [Whisperer](http://whisperer.herokuapp.com/) ###
#### Made by John Kohler, Lukas Berger, and Greg Skloot ####

Connects with Facebook so users can post about their friends anonymously.
Similar to the popular Facebook groups like 'northeastern complements' and
'spotted', but offers a cleaner interface and immediate posting without a
middle-man.

### [Why Not](https://github.com/stephalee/challenge) ###
#### Made by Korbin Shuffleton, Martin Manser, and Stephanie Lee ####

An app that allows users to create and complete challenges. The goal is to
provide a medium for people to encourage others to try different activities in
the form of challenges.

### [Applitude](https://github.com/arjunblj/applitude) ###
#### Made by Arjun Balaji and Luke Van Seters ####

There is currently a grave deficit of audio-based adaptive color displays. With
new technology such as Hue looking to help users express themselves in the
somewhat untouched realm of illumination, we seek to be their shining light.

### [baskets.io](https://github.com/dboudro/baskets.io) ###
#### Made by Dylan Boudro and Kate Hutchinson ####

Baskets.io visualizes important spheres of your life using D3.js

We create one 'basket' visualization for each aspect of your life you would like
to monitor (eg. Academic, Financial, Sleep, Health, etc).

Each basket contains nodes that correspond to important events in that sphere of
your life. A large red node would depict a big purchase in your financial sphere
while a small purple node would depict a power nap in your sleep schedule
sphere.

We think this product could be used for business productivity tracking, personal
management... really anything that needs to be easily and playfully tracked!

### [Fuel](https://github.com/timothychong/Fuel-App) ###
#### Made by Akshar Bonu, Timothy Chong, and Calvin Chin ####

Fuel leverages key aspects of human nature -- the desire to set challenges for
oneself. But, we are not like the millions of other challenge apps are there
because we've made a challenge app that makes sure that you never fail -- that
you never run out of fuel.

When you make a challenge, you're motivated, you know exactly why you're doing
what you're doing. Over the course of your challenge, you may want to give up
because you've forgotten or can't feel what made you start. We solve that.

Fuel lets you save what inspired you to make your challenge as messages, videos,
and images to your later self that can recall on them when he or she maybe low
on inspiration -- or as we like to say, low on fuel.

We've made a challenge app that actually works.

### [General Chombie](http://generalchombie.com) ###
#### Made by Marco Chiang and Steven Tso ####

Ever set up an alarm in the morning only to find yourself snoozing all the time
and leaving yourself an unknown amount of time to get ready for class or work?

General Chombie is the ultimate Pebble application that keeps you on track with
your schedule. We break your morning routine down and set a timer for each
individual task.

For example, wake up at 6am and the first task is to shower. Your watch wakes
you up and tells you your first task is to shower and starts the timer for 10
minutes to get in and out. As soon as your 10 minutes is up it moves onto the
next task. You now have 2 minutes to brush your teeth... etc.

Our goal is to help business professionals, students, and anyone with a routine
to make sure they are on schedule to make sure they can get to the important
things in their day.

### [valas (the Vengeful Auth.Log Analysis Script)](https://github.com/markmossberg/valas) ###
#### Made by Mark Mossberg ####

Have you ever happened to glance through some of your Ubuntu server logs and
noticed an awful lot of really weird log in attempts from IP Addresses and users
you don't recognize? Well have no fear, because ""valas"" (the Vengeful Auth.Log
Analysis Script) is here to shed some light on this scene and give you some
facts and analytics about these login attempts.
